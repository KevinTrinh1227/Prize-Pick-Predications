    Project name: Prize Pick Predictions
    Author: Kevin Huy Trinh
    Date created: March 2022
    Python Version: 3.11.1
    Dependencies: Requirement.txt
    Description: Python program that makes recommendations on
        betting in favor/against a player's prize pick line_score
        value using a linear regression machine learning algorithm
        that takes into account the opposing team's elo, and the
        desired player's current seasonal score in diff stat types.
